                <li>If this isn't one of the most highly anticipated rock albums to come out sometime in the near future, I don't know what is. Glenn Hughes (lead vocals, bass) tweeted about the band's recording in Los Angeles and that their upcoming album BCC V is done. This supergroup includes guitarist Joe Bonamassa, vocalist/bassist Glenn Hughes (Deep Purple, The Dead Daisies), drummer Jason Bonham (Led Zeppelin) and keyboardist Derek Sherinian (Dream Theater, Alice Cooper). The band entered Sunset Sound studio in Hollywood California to record their fifth studio album. Glenn Hughes reported on twitter that 10 tracks were recorded and “there's a lot of magical music being made.” Can we please have a release date? We can't wait.</li>
